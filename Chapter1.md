Chapter 1

Gary, Zack and Abigail head to the store to buy food and drinks for the party.

They expect to have hundreds of guests.

As a result, they buy hundreds of cans of soda and hundreds of bags of chips.

College life is a hard time so they can't afford to buy anything more expensive.

They clog up the cashier on the way out, but manage to leave in record time.

Somehow, they fit all the soda and chips into Abigail's car.

It's a miracle.

They make their way back to the house in one piece.

When unpacking, they realize they have another problem.

How are they going to fit all these chips and sodas into Abigail's tiny, tiny house?
