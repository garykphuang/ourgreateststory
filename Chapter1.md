Chapter 1

Gary, Zack and Abigail head to the store to buy food and drinks for the party.

They expect to have hundreds of guests.

As a result, they buy hundreds of cans of soda and hundreds of bags of chips.

College life is a hard time so they can't afford to buy anything more expensive.

They clog up the cashier on the way out, but manage to leave in record time.

Gary attachs a wagon to the back of Abigail's bike.

Zack stands to the side, supervising, while eatng a bag of chips.

Abigail and Gary manage to carefully stack the cans and bags in the wagon.

It's a miracle.

Gary and Zack climb into the wagon and Abigail bikes them home.

Shockingly, they make their way back to the house in one piece.

Especially considering Abigail was already drunk and sucks at biking anyways.

When unpacking, they realize they have another problem.

How are they going to fit all these chips and sodas into Abigail's tiny, tiny house?

Which is totally a lie because her house has literally 4 stories.
