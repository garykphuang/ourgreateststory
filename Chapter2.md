# Chapter 2

"How many people did you invite?" Gary shouted over the music.

Abigail leaned forward, the drink in her plastic cup sloshing over the rim.

"I dunno," she said, "probably about 100?"

"100?" Zack shouted, "I invited 200!"

Gary shoved a *v* drunk football player out of his way.

"Is this venue even big enough for all these people?"

Abigail shrugged.

"It will be once we raise the roof!

Now shut up, it's time for shots!"

For the first time since this whole party started, Zack's ears perk up.

"Shots? Woooo!"

Zack then takes a swig from a beer left on the dining table before he pulls out his guitar and begins to serenade partygoers with the blues.

While all of this is going on, Gary calls a construction company.

He is working on getting the roof raised, for the cheap cheap price of two sodas.

The construction company says that they'll take the job!
