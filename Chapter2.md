"How many people did you invite?" Gary shouted over the music.

Abigail leaned forward, the drink in her plastic cup sloshing over the rim.

"I dunno," she said, "probably about 100?"

"100?" Zack shouted, "I invited 200!"

Gary shoved a *v* drunk football player out of his way.

"Is this venue even big enough for all these people?"

Abigail shrugged.

"It will be once we raise the roof!

Now shut up, it's time for shots!"

While all of this is going on, Gary calls a construction company.

He is working on getting the roof raised.
