Chapter 3: The Aftermath

The zigzag team wake up the next morning.

It is a Nuclear Apocalypse.

Everyone is dead.

A car arrives and takes them to an outpost.

The outpost is a safe haven for people to survive after the apocalypse.

Going outside is not allowed because of radiation.

Copulation is also not allowed.

The anti-christ is there as well as robots and the Latex monster.

This is some AHS shit.

The zigzag team are SHOOKETH.

Suddenly snakes appear out of nowhere.

No one knows where they came from as they should have been dead.

Miss Venable, the head of the outpost kills them with a cleaver.

They end up eating a snake soup.

And then the snakes turn into living snakes inside them.

They all die because of their poison.

Suddenly Zack wakes up and screams "SUDO!"

Then he dies again.
