Chapter 3: The Aftermath

The zigzag team wake up the next morning.

It is a Nuclear Apocalypse.

Everyone is dead.

A car arrives and takes them to an outpost.

The outpost is a safe haven for people to survive after the apocalypse.

Going outside is not allowed because of radiation.

Copulation is also not allowed.

The anti-christ is there as well as robots and the Latex monster.

This is some AHS shit.

The zigzag team are SHOOKETH.
