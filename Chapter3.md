Chapter 3: The Aftermath

The zigzag team wake up the next morning.

It is a Nuclear Apocalypse.

Everyone is dead, except for the zigzag team.

At least that's what they think.

A hippie van with some Scooby Doo decals arrives and takes them to an outpost.

The outpost is a safe haven for people to survive after the apocalypse.

Going outside is not allowed because of radiation.

Copulation is also not allowed, unless the Grandmaster gives permission.

The anti-christ is there as well as robots and the Latex monster.

This is some AHS shit.

The zigzag team are SHOOKETH.
